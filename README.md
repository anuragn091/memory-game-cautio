## 📋 Overview
- The Memory Game is a modern, feature-rich web application built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides an engaging card-matching experience with user authentication, session tracking, and comprehensive game statistics.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
### Frontend Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Hooks (useState, useCallback, useMemo, useEffect)
- Performance: React.memo with custom comparison functions

## Key Technologies
- Local Storage: Persistent user data and session management
- Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimization
- Dark Mode: Complete theme system with smooth transitions
- Performance Optimization: Memoization and isolated component rendering


## 🎮 Core Functionalities
  1. User Authentication System
- - `Login/Registration`: Email-based user identification
- - `Session Persistence`: Automatic login state restoration
- - `User Dashboard`: Personalized game statistics and history
 2. Dynamic Game Board
- - `Adaptive Grid`: Automatically adjusts board size based on icon count (`4×4, 5×5, 6×6`)
- - `Responsive Tiles`: Scales appropriately for different screen sizes
- - `Smart Matching`: Two-tile selection with visual feedback
3. Session Management
- - `Game Tracking`: Records start time, duration, and completion status
- - `Statistics Dashboard`: Total games, completed, and lost sessions
- - `Session History`: Detailed view of all previous games
4. Game Controls
- - `Start Game`: Initiates new session with unique game number
- - `Stop Gam`e: Confirmation modal with session recording
- - `Win Detection`: Automatic completion tracking with celebration

## 🚀 Performance Improvements
1. Before Optimization
- - ❌ Timer updates caused entire page re-renders
- - ❌ Clicking tiles re-rendered entire board
- - ❌ Function recreation on every render
- - ❌ Unnecessary DOM updates
2. After Optimization
- - ✅ Isolated timer component prevents parent re-renders
- - ✅ Only changed tiles re-render using memo
- - ✅ Stable function references with zero dependencies
- - ✅ Custom comparison functions for precise control
